Nodewords README.txt
==============================================================================

This module allows you to set some meta tags for each node.

Giving more attention to the important keywords and/or description on some of
your nodes allows you to get better search engine positioning (given that you
really only provide the keywords which exist in the node body itself, and do
not try to lie).

This version of the module only works with Drupal 6.x.

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some features include:

* The current supported meta tags are ABSTRACT, COPYRIGHT, DESCRIPTION,
  GEOURL, KEYWORDS and ROBOTS.

* You can define a global set of KEYWORDS that will appear on each page of
  your site. Node specific keywords are added before these global
  keywords.

* You can tell "nodewords" to add all terms of some specified vocabularies
  to the KEYWORDS meta tag.

* You can define a global COPYRIGHT tag. You can optionally override this
  copyright on one or more node pages.

* You can define a global GEOURL tag. You can optionally override this
  GeoURL on one or more node pages.

* You can optionally insert the teaser as a DESCRIPTION tag, if you leave
  the DESCRIPTION tag empty.

* You can specify a default ROBOTS tag to use for all pages. You can override
  this on each page.

* On taxonomy pages, the term description is used as the DESCRIPTION
  tag. The term itself is added to the list of KEYWORDS. You can override
  the description to use if you wish.

* You can seperately specify the meta tags to show on the front page of
  your site. See also configuration below.

* The module added support for META tags for views pages (see views
  module) in version 5.x-1.3. For this feature you need views-5.x-1.6 or
  later. Similar support for panels pages (see panels module) has been
  added to version 5.x-1.4. For this feature you need panels-5.x-1.2 or
  later.
  The support has been removed from Nodewords 6.x-1.x on August 15, 2009;
  successive version for Drupal 6 replaced the support for Views, and Panels
  with a more generic support for third-party module pages.

* You can select which of these tags you want to output on each page. You
  can also remove the edit box for these tags from the node edit page if
  you don't like using it.

* All text of the DESCRIPTION and KEYWORDS meta tags are added to the search
  system so they are searable too.

Installing Nodewords (aka Meta tags) (first time installation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Backup your database.

2. Copy the complete 'nodewords/' directory into the 'modules/' directory of
   your Drupal site.

3. Enable the "Nodewords" module from the module administration page
   (Administer >> Site configuration >> Modules).

4. Configure the module (see "Configuration" below).

Upgrading Nodewords (aka Meta tags) (on Drupal 4.7 or later)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Backup your database.

2. Remove the old 'nodewords.module' or old 'nodewords/' directory from the
   'modules/' directory of your Drupal site (possible after making a backup
   of it).

3. Copy the complete 'nodewords/' directory into the 'modules/' directory of
   your Drupal site.

4. Go to the modules administration page ("Administer >> Site configuration
   >> Modules") and select to run update.php to update the database.

   The data from the previous version will automatically be converted to
   the new format if needed.

5. Configure the module (see "Configuration" below) if needed.

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. On the access control administration page ("Administer >> User management
   >> Access control") you need to assign:

   + the "administer nodewords" permission to the roles that are allowed to
     administer the meta tags (such as setting the default values and/or
     enabling the possibility to edit them),

   + the "edit XYZ tag" permission to the roles that are allowed to set and
     edit meta tags for the content (there is a permission for each of the
     meta tags currently defined).

   All users will be able to see the assigned meta tags.

2. On the settings page ("Administer >> Content management >>
   Nodewords") you can specify the default settings for the module.
   Users need the "administer nodewords" permission to do this.

3. The front page is an important page for each website. Therefor you can
   specifically set the meta tags to use on the front page meta tags
   settings page ("Administer >> Content management >> Nodewords >>
   Front page").
   Users need the "administer nodewords" permission to do this.

   Alternatively, you can opt not to set the meta tags for the front page
   on this page, but to use the meta tags of the view, panel or node the
   front page points to. To do this, you need to uncheck the "Use front
   page meta tags" option on the settings page.

   Note that, in contrast to previous versions of this module, the site
   mission and/or site slogan are no longer used as DESCRIPTION or ABSTRACT
   on the front page!

4. You can completely disable the possibility to edit meta tags for each
   individual content type by editing the content type workflow options
   ("Administer >> Content management >> Content types").

   Note that this will still output the default values for the meta tags.

Using Nodewords and Tagadelic
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tagadelic module (http://drupal.org/project/tagadelic) allows one to
create a cloud of all terms used. The keywords you assign to nodes with
the Nodewords module will not appear in these clouds.

If you want to use tagclouds and have the same terms in the KEYWORDS meta
tag, you can configure nodewords as follows:

1. Create a "Free tagging" vocabulary at "Administer >> Content management
   >> Categories". For example, call this vocabulary "Keywords".

2. On the meta tags settings page ("Administer >> Content management >>
   Nodewords"), select the "Keywords" vocabulary as one of the "Auto-keywords
   vocabularies". This will make sure that all terms you assign to nodes
   will appear in the KEYWORDS meta tag.

3. On the same page, deselect the checkbox "Keywords" in the "Tags to
   show on edit form" fieldset. This will remove the KEYWORDS meta tag
   input box on all node edit forms. The only way to assign KEYWORDS then
   is to enter them in the vocabulary "Keywords" input box (which will
   appear in the "Categories" box instead of the "Meta tags" one).

The result is that the KEYWORDS meta tag will only contain the keywords
assigned to nodes by entering them in the free-tagging input box of the
"Keywords" vocabulary. Nodewords will add them to the KEYWORDS meta tag
and you can use a tagcloud to show all keywords too.

Auto-generated meta DESCRIPTION for CCK content types
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The nodewords module uses the teaser of a node as the auto-generated
DESCRIPTION for nodes if instructed to do so on the meta tags settings
page (Administer >> Content management >> Nodewords). Unfortunately, for
CCK (Content Construction Kit) content types, this teaser is not really
useful for use as meta DESCRIPTION.

It is recommended to use the contemplate (Content Template) module to
create a nicer looking node teaser that can also be used as auto-generated
DESCRIPTION.

Note that nodewords module does not use the node.tpl.php file (or any
node-*.tpl.php file) from your theme as teaser because in general this
includes the "Submitted by ..." text which should not be included in
the meta tag.
